Assessment of the code:
The code includes comments and PHPDoc blocks, which can help other developers understand the purpose of the class and its methods. This is a good practice for maintaining code readability and ease of documentation.
The code makes use of Laravelâ€™s Eloquent ORM for database interactions, which simplifies the process of querying the database and reduces the amount of SQL code that needs to be written manually.

Opportunities for improvement:
There are a lot of if conditions we can use when method of laravel in queries for more clarity which make it easy to understand,
Modern PHP supports type declarations for function parameters and return types. Adding these can improve the reliability and self-documenting nature of the code.

Weaknesses of the code:
Controllers lack data validations, error handling, and try-catch exceptions, which can lead to potential issues in production.
Need to DB transactions for data consistency in saving to avoid data failure.
There's a noticeable amount of repetition, especially in validation logic. Laravel's request validation or custom request classes could dry up this repetition, centralize validation rules, and declutter controller/repository methods.
sendNotification code written multiple times.

Recommendations for improvement:
Implement data validation and authorization using Laravel's FormRequest.
We can make response format for both APIs and website in this can we can use resources to send proper response.
Follow a consistent naming convention for methods and variables, using camelCase for methods and underscores for variables.
There are hardcoded values and strings throughout the code (e.g., user role IDs, response messages). These could be extracted into configuration files or constants, making the code easier to maintain and localize for different languages.
We can write a dynamic functions for PushNotifications and EmailNotifications to avoid duplication of code.

Remarks on formatting:
While the code generally follows a readable format, there are inconsistencies in spacing, alignment, and method organization. Adopting a tool like PHP CS Fixer or integrating PHP_CodeSniffer with a predefined coding standard (e.g., PSR-2) could enforce consistency.
Large Function should be divided in small functions. This approach not only facilitates easier testing but also enhances the reusability and maintainability of the code.

Note: I only made some changes to show my approach It may have errors, but I just want to let you know how can we Improve code like this.
